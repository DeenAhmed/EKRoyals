## Aim of the site

The client has stated they wanted a new website to be able to showcase an overview of their club and have asked for this to be designed to the following specifications;

A website to showcase the offerings of a Youth Basketball Club based in East Kilbride, Glasgow.
The primary aim of the website is to showcase the Club and what activities they offer.

The club chairman and group have provided me with the following goals for the site.

1. A simple but professional design.
2. A space to show the age group training days.
3. A space to show the many tournaments they have.
4. A form to allow users to sign up for tournaments.

## UX

As the club is fairly established in their local town, the main aim is to grow the clubs members and exposure throughout the local authority.

### Target audience

- Young People with interest in basketball.
- Parents or guardians looking for an activity for their young family.

### User requirements and expectations

- A clear navigation that makes it easy to see what information is available on the site.
- Links and functions that work as expected.
- Consistency across pages.
- Fully responsive for viewing on any device.

## Design

I came up with the following keywords for the site:

- Welcoming
- Modern
- Simplistic
- User friendly

### Fonts

The classic font "Arial" is used throughout the whole site. I chose to use this as it is bold and easy to read against an imaged background.

### Background

All the pages have the same background, I went for a simple image of a basketball and a team playing in the back. I used this because it intrigues the user and gives the site a modern look.

## Features

### Title and Navigation

The page title, navigation and social media links are shown at the top of every page. They're fully responsive.

### Home

The Home page has a brief overview of the club and what they do. Along with a button that links to the contact page.
